# AVL-Tree-Visualizer

A desktop application built in Java that visualizes the self-balancing nature of AVL Trees. This tool helps students and developers understand how **rotations** (LL, RR, LR, RL) maintain tree balance in real-time.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the tree restructure itself as you add nodes.
- **Dynamic Balancing**: Implements the AVL algorithm to ensure a maximum height difference of 1 between subtrees.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple "input-and-visualize" workflow using Java Swing.
- **Adaptive Layout**: Automatically adjusts node spacing to prevent overlapping.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java JDK** installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/rohanmadanu/AVL-Tree-Visualizer.git](https://github.com/rohanmadanu/AVL-Tree-Visualizer.git)
